**2. How We Use Your Information**

We use your data solely to provide core features of the app:

- Displaying mood history and context
- Powering offline mood trends (future update)

We do **not** collect, sell, or share your data with third parties.

**3. Data Storage**

All data is stored **locally** on your Android device via secure local storage (Room DB). If you uninstall the app, your data is deleted unless you've exported it.

These permissions are optional but recommended for the best experience.
